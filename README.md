# ECCV 2024: [Rethinking Features-Fused-Pyramid-Neck for Object Detection](https://eccv.ecva.net/virtual/2024/poster/1537)
(I would like to call it _Slim Neck V2_. V1 is the [_Slim Neck by GSConv_](https://github.com/AlanLi1997/slim-neck-by-gsconv).ðŸ˜€)
The code will be released soon.


A little easter egg - Cheems(Balltze). When I was doing this work, the Cheems brought me a lot of happy energy, but it had already left this world before I finished the work. I liked it so much that I put the image of it that stuck with me the most in the key figure of this paper. Thank you to cute little animals like the Cheems for healing our hearts.
